                  “The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire” (LORDE 54). The erotic is a measure. What does it mean to measure the distance between self and chaos, between “experience” and its “revelatory distillation (LORDE 54)”? One might experience the “phenomenological behavior of chaos” as a “seemingly random and unpredictable behavior that nevertheless follows precise rules” 128. A measure can be calculated and marked. A measure has meters and beats that combine to form rhythms. A measure is a vector between two network nodes, whether musical, digital, social, or neural. A measure is one piece of a larger map, breaking down something large and difficult to understand into its component parts. A measure is orderly, even if its surrounding context is not. A measure helps to make sense of the chaos, whether musical, digital, social, or neural; a measure is a processing tool. 4 4/4 beats measure messy melodies; a vote measures a disorderly society. Electrodes measure neural activity; an algorithm measures digital data. The erotic, a sense of satisfaction, tracks and calculates a path to navigate the chaos of experience; once we feel that satisfaction, the satisfaction of navigating the chaos of experience, we know that we can feel it again. I don't think this is a calculation of truth and veracity as much as it is a calculation of desire and satisfaction. A measure of the depth of one’s feeling, a measure that may appear random at first glance but upon closer inspection is highly attuned, responsive, and logical, even algorithmic.
To the extent that an algorithm is simply a “set of defined steps structured to process instructions/data to produce an output (KITCHIN 2), it's hard to talk about algorithms without talking about desire...what outputs do we continually seek when we input the chaos of experience? is it that we seek from the chaos of experience? The erotic does not allow us to pretend that we are not part of the calculation being ran. Rather, we are where the calculation begins. The idea that a measure calculates the relationship between two points masks the underlying calculation, figuring the relationship between self and our desire for satisfaction, our strongest feeling. I think it is this triangulation between self, chaos, and satisfaction that has me turning to the erotic as a way of thinking about algorithmic processing. What does it mean to consider algorithmic desire as a third vector point? Or perhaps it is the only node? An algorithm calculates not truth, but satisfaction. Think about a recipe. A user might follow the recipe’s steps, produce a meal at the end, but find that the meal does not satisfy them. So, they add spices and sauces, tweaking the recipe to produce a new, satisfactory one. An algorithm that ends not at some kind of “truth”, not at the verifiable and replicable result at the end of the recipe, but ends at one’s own satisfaction.

                  Think about data surveillant policing. A user might read the documentation and follow the analysis platform (Palantir Gotham, for example,) manual’s steps, produce a data record from the built-in data ontology (“a computerized assessment tool” (RICHARDSON ET AL 208) like the Strategic Subject List, for example,) that reads a verifiable and replicable truth about the input dataset (ranking citizens according to their “risk of becoming a victim or possible offender” in a crime, such as a “shooting or homicide,” a narrative calculated by combining “numerous sources of information to analyze crime” (RICHARDSON ET AL 208) using platforms like Palantir Gotham), but find that the data narrative does not satisfy their needs, so they “drill down” to produce the data narrative “outcomes [they] desire” (PG OBJECT EXPLORER 4). An algorithm that ends not simply at a verifiable truth, but at their satisfactorily verifiable truth. Think about Chat GPT and generative art. A user might enter a prompt that pattern-matches with a verifiable answer according to the parameters of the prompt (a process that some call ‘intelligence’), but the user is not satisfied with the answer they have received, so they continue to refine the prompt until the prompt matches the desired answer. An algorithmic intelligence producing not simply a verifiable truth, but a satisfactorily verifiable truth. Think about TikTok. A user might post a vlog of their daily activities, or the instructions for a recipe, or a retelling of a pivotal historical event, or an explanation of who to vote for in an upcoming election, or stock advice regarding highly profitable technology companies. The video has been posted, it is a part of the platform record, but the video does not produce satisfactory engagement in response, so the user might tweak their hashtags or post caption or content to attract attention, producing a verifiably satisfactory engagement result. Think about TikTok. A chaos of users post to the platform, and as a result the newsfeed is accurately chaotic, a verifiable truth, but an unsatisfactory UI/UX truth. So the platform’s developers tweak the algorithm to pattern-match for certain kinds of content, certain kinds of faces, certain kinds of movements. An algorithm producing a verifiable newsfeed narrative that is both politically and financially satisfactory, from the developers to the political parties that clock them in and out.

                  Algorithms, a programmatic path we believe moves us from the chaos of the world to the truth of the matter, move us from ourselves to the chaos of our desire for satisfaction; the erotic does not let us off the hook for our desire. For we are based in these desires; each of us is one process for ordering the chaos of the world. The chaos of the open interval, “the things I wanted--: love’s gorgeous force:-- a tight fat cloud of blue hydrangea--: someone coaxed the soil to color ] the universe: --cancer of the hallelu:-- [ my name in his mouth: -- an arrogance of vapor--:” (VAN CLIEF-STEFANON 16) a squinting-distance “between body and name” (VAN CLIEF-STEFANON 43), held at bay by an array of brackets carrying the bites of our satisfaction. In being open about our algorithmic desires, perhaps we create the space for our desires to become aspirations. What does it mean to arrive at satisfaction instead of a verifiable truth? Satisfaction, as measured not in votes or dollars but in steps, syllables, and stanzas. An interface between the self and chaos; a way of handling and making sense of information in a format that can be returned to again and again. These erotic data objects are a critical interface; they “form the quality of light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action” (LORDE 37).
When black feminist poet Audre Lorde engages with women through, whether in family, community, work, friendship, or lovemaking, she takes them in as a living, breathing collection of information. Ten pages into her biomythgraphy, Zami, A New Spelling of My Name, she illustrates her mother, Linda Belmar Lorde, as a poetic measure of the information that “Linda knows”. This database spans from the island of Carriacou in Grenada, where Lorde’s parents Byron were born, to Lenox Avenue in Harlem, where the newlyweds moved in 1924 in search of work. Lorde repeats the phrase “she knew” or a variation of it seventeen times, detailing all of the things Linda knows:

	let lindaKnew = [];

for (let index = 0; index < lindaBelmarLorde.length; index++) {
    lindaKnew.push(lindaBelmarLorde.knew[index]);
    console.log(lindaKnew);
}

These data points are interspersed with things that “Linda missed,” indexed six times:

	let lindaMissed = [];

for (let index = 0; index < lindaBelmarLorde.length; index++) {
    lindaKnew.push(lindaBelmarLorde.missed[index]);
    console.log(lindaMissed);
};

Not only does Lorde take her mother seriously as a composition of information, she privileges her mother’s data over data found in mainstream sources. She ends her report on her mother with a précis of the things Linda knew about “home,” Carriacou:

let carriacou = [];
for (let index = 0; index < lindaBelmarLorde.length; index++) {
    lindaKnew.push(lindaBelmarLorde.home[index]);
    console.log(carriacou);
};

                  She soon learned this was not the state record, the first of many times she clashes with the institutional narrative. Despite being so deeply felt as a place and as a self orientation, a way of coming to know herself and the world, Carriacou “was not listed in the index of the Goode’s School Atlas nor in the Junior Americana World Gazette nor appeared on any map that [Lorde] could find”. She notes in a footnote that “as a partial requirement for a degree in library science, [she] did a detailed comparison of atlases…[the isle of Carriacou] appeared only once, in the Atlas of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, which has always prided itself upon the accurate cartology of its colonies” (LORDE 14). No matter what a grade-school atlas illustrated, knowledge of Carriacou gained through the data of experience was deeply stored and felt within Linda Belmar Lorde and transmitted from mother to daughter. Lorde stored it deeply within her as her own data of place and home and distilled the information into poetry, “a revelatory distillation of experience” (LORDE 38). A revelatory distillation of experience connotes information about the world broken down for the kernels of observable truth within, truths that build up again as new experiential data enters and is distilled again. To think about poetry as data analysis means to take seriously that which we take in to our senses as data, and poetics as a process of analyzing that data. To Lorde, this “is poetry as illumination”; “the quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we hope to bring about through those lives” (36). It is key to our human ability to think and dream big toward revolution and survival that we create poetry, and in so doing take in the data of the world and distill it for the critical underlying truth.

                  With the data Lorde received from her mother, she “spun visions of sapadilla and mango as a net over [her] Harlem tenement cot in the snoring darkness”.125 These visions were as deeply felt for her as they were for her mother, augmenting the reality she experienced in her family’s tiny Harlem tenement. Lorde’s spun visions, her virtual poetry, were erotic: “a measure between the beginnings of [her] sense of self and the chaos of [her] strongest feelings.” Aggregation and analysis is looking, listening, touching, smelling, and tasting, data condensed into revelation —poetry. Erotic data poetics means understanding that analysis, that revelation, or truth, as a measure of a depth of feeling. I take the word measure here at its multiple meanings, both as a quantifier expressing an amount and as the container holding the rhythm of poetry or music. 
Lorde’s spun vision of fruit and trees, her poetry, act as an emotion picture holding her mother’s information, connecting her to the depths and distances of her ancestry, continuing to refine as new data comes in. Her data set aggregates, and she condenses it into a poem, a tangible data object; the data set of experience aggregates and grows again, she spins it smaller again. This poetic pattern of growth and refinement is a rhythm in itself; indeed, rhythm operates as an “answer to chaos…there is rhythm wherever there is a transcoded passage from one milieu,” meaning setting or context, “to another”.127 As information shifts setting—another way of framing data analysis— following an encoded path from one context to the next, it creates a pattern by which the unpredictability of chaotic data aggregation can be navigated. 
a counter-rhythm to the metronomic tone of the “snoring darkness” that enveloped young Audre in her Harlem cot. The snore of darkness has a steady meter of its own but it lacks the quality of contextual shift and transformation. It is “dogmatic, but rhythm is critical; it ties together critical moments…[rhythm] changes direction.130 Lorde’s data visions were a net over her, blowing in a Carriacou wind infused with lush trees and sweet fruit, sensual and multidirectional. This is a rhythm that could not be mistaken for the droning dogma of meter, “the sterile word play that, too often, the white fathers distorted the word poetry to mean — in order to cover a disparate wish for imagination without insight”.131 Poetry is experiential information analysis minus sterile word play, sensual and multidirectional instructions for transcoding feeling data and moving it to a new context; an erotic algorithm.

                  Linda Belmar Lorde knew many ways to make children behave in public—sometimes candy, sometimes coercive force. As a child Lorde “never spoke to DeLois,” a woman who “lived up the block on 142nd Street…because [her] mother didn’t.” DeLois “never had her hair done, and all the neighborhood women sucked their teeth as she walked by”. Despite this scan by the local surveillance network of Black women on their front porches, for which DeLois was flagged for erasure, “her crispy hair twinkled in the summer sun as her big proud stomach moved her on down the block.” The same child’s eye that measured Linda as woman + power and downloaded the instruction not to speak still “watched” DeLois as she “moved…not caring whether or not she was a poem.” Lorde’s scan, powered by an erotic data algorithm, output love; she “loved DeLois because she was big and Black and special and seemed to laugh all over,” because “hot noon threw a ring of sunlight like a halo on the top of DeLois’ stomach, like a spotlight, making [Lorde] sorry that [she] was so flat”.133

Lorde dedicates her biomythography to the woman she has become, the “images of women” that informed her development guide the path to her narrative, foregrounding looking and watching as a central theme. From her mother onward, women stood for Lorde like “dykes,” the bright light separating her from “chaos”. Women kept Lorde safe from impending storms, and were the measure of her strongest feelings. Through her girl’s eye, positioned to orient herself upward toward women from underneath, she made it her business to look:

let deLoisImg = [];

for (let index = 0; index < deLois.length; index++) {
    deLoisImg.push(deLois[index])
    console.log(deLoisImg);
};

Her girl’s view scan, focused up from underneath, registered that a world of new information lay beneath women’s blouses. She didn’t know what the data was, only that it presented itself to her as a swollen mystery; immediately she began to find ways to suss out the secrets. When DeLois made her way down the block, a counter-rhythm to the repressive scan of Linda Belmar Lorde and the respectable Black ladies of the block, Lorde “tied [her] shoes and tried to peep under [DeLois’s] blouse”.135 Her peeping is not only for pleasure, though it originates in her nascent sexual desire. Rather, she scans, analyses, and catalogues women as they come across her path, trying to take full account of the picture they present before her, good or bad, and distill the information into a kind of poetry that moves and guides her. As the images of women reach her, and the somatic data contained within those images impacts her, she is left trying to figure out how, why, and what to do next. These images of women are so impactful to Lorde that she dedicates the woman she has become to them. I might say the same.

                  a measure between is a short snippet of a longer project in progress, pynk.codes, deriving from my dissertation Dirty Computers: Erotic Data Poetics, which explores data analysis through the framework of queer black feminist poetics. The dataset behind the project comes from a collection of the following songs by black women artists as they interface with the chaos of their strongest feelings:

let ambSongs = []

The song lyrics were put into a large database separating each word into its own index position. This list of words was run through Chat GPT-4 to identify the part of speech and number of syllables in each word, using the following prompts:

Let chatGPTPrompts = []

I used ChatGPT-4 in this project for two reasons: its on-face practicality, but also as an exploration of what natural language processing means and looks like using the ChatGPT interface. This was my first time using any of the GPT libraries or natural language processing of any sort on a database that I was working with; this was also the first time I was working with a database that was almost 700 lines long. Rather than spend a literal week going through my spreadsheet identifying parts of speech and syllable counts, risking losing my place in a 700 page spreadsheet and with it my will to complete this project, I finally logged into ChatGPT for the first time and fed it my prompts and list of words. What would have taken me countless mind-numbing hours to process took ChatGPT about ninety minutes. A large chunk of that time was dedicated to working around the fact that the algorithm kept flagging my list of words as inappropriate, which brings me to my second reason for using ChatGPT on this project. I wanted to see how it would identify the terms in use, many of them slang and vernacular terms used by Black women, and how it would deduce that these words were pronounced in order to determine an accurate syllable count.
